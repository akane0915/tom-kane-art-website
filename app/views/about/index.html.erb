      <h3>A Note From The Painter</h3>

      <p>When asked "what is it you paint", my short answer is to describe my realistic style:  "well, you know it's a tree." However, it's my tree. </p>

      <p>That is the pivotal point. To get the viewer to see the tree differently, in a new way. To expand any previous conception thru paint.</p>

      <p>Combined with the particular way the paint comes off my brush,
      this makes for a singular statement and sensation.
      Hopefully.</p>

      <p>Otherwise one might as well take a photograph, which could well be better than any painterly duplication.</p>

      <p>After 37 years "painting with light" (making movies),
      it's time to return to the paint brush.</p>
